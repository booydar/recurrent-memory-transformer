       " 'input': 'Why is Si retirement so significant to the Space Exploration Team? \\n\\n (A) There aren’t enough working people in the world. They won’t be able to find a replacement.\\n (B) As one of two remaining spacemen, it would likely mean the defunding and shut down of the Space Exploration Team.\\n (C) Training new spacemen is costly and time consuming. They won’t have anyone else ready after him.\\n (D) His retirement may inspire others to stop working as well, which would be hugely detrimental as most people don\\'t feel the drive to work as is.  \\n\\n\\nSPACEMAN ON A SPREE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   BY MACK REYNOLDS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Illustrated by Nodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   What\\'s more important—Man\\'s conquest\\n\\n\\n   of space, or one spaceman\\'s life?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'What makes Gubelin an outlier in the present day?\\n\\n (A) He is much older than the rest of the population.\\n (B) He refuses new operations that could improve his health.\\n (C) His mind is still active, and he values hard work.\\n (D) He still wears glasses and value objects like the gold watch given to Si.\\n\\n\\nSPACEMAN ON A SPREE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   BY MACK REYNOLDS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Illustrated by Nodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   What\\'s more important—Man\\'s conquest\\n\\n\\n   of space, or one spaceman\\'s life?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'What is the main reason that Gubelin is so resentful of Si’s decision?\\n\\n (A) He doesn’t want to have to go through the effort of training a new spaceman, as it’s very costly and time consuming.\\n (B) He regrets not having the opportunity of space exploration himself.\\n (C) He fears the end of the Space Exploration program, and for mankind’s research of space to come to an end.\\n (D) He hates the Welfare State and how it’s taken away people’s drive to learn and explore.\\n\\n\\nSPACEMAN ON A SPREE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   BY MACK REYNOLDS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Illustrated by Nodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   What\\'s more important—Man\\'s conquest\\n\\n\\n   of space, or one spaceman\\'s life?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux.

They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'What is the “space cafard” that Si describes? \\n\\n (A) It’s the isolation that spacemen feel working alone in space, with only computers as company\\n (B) It’s the public’s adverse opinion of space exploration that Gubelin tries to hide.\\n (C) It’s the desire to return home from a long voyage.\\n (D) It is the current system of operations for spacecraft, where people man ships with only one person.\\n\\n\\nSPACEMAN ON A SPREE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   BY MACK REYNOLDS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Illustrated by Nodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   What\\'s more important—Man\\'s conquest\\n\\n\\n   of space, or one spaceman\\'s life?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\n\\n\\n    our\\n\\n\\n   minds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\n\\n\\n    con\\n\\n\\n   you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Zo-ro-as-ter\\n\\n\\n   ,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\n\\n\\n    every\\n\\n\\n   pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"\\n\\n\\n    Academician\\n\\n\\n   Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\n\\n\\n    Doc\\n\\n\\n   ?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'What caused the error in O\\'Rielly\\'s controls? \\n\\n (A) A control malfunctioned and reset itself.\\n (B) He missed something when they were preparing. \\n (C) The controls weren\\'t locked before take-off. \\n (D) The Venus woman tampered with it. \\n\\n\\nIMAGE OF SPLENDOR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   By LU KELLA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,\\n\\n\\n    it was a hell of a world for men ... and\\n\\n\\n    Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly particularly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The intercom roared fit to blow O\\'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"On my way, sir!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman\\n O\\'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already\\n throwing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble\\n whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\\n the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\\n chance! Swiftly O\\'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\\n throbbing rumble changed tone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Callahan\\'s voice crackled now through the helmet\\'s ear contact.\\n \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\\n Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn\\'t you lock them controls before\\n blast-off?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"If every control hadn\\'t been locked in correct setting,\" O\\'Rielly\\n answered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\\n registered before blast-off—wouldn\\'t it, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I don\\'t know yet, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The icy knot in O\\'Rielly\\'s stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\\n this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O\\'Rielly\\'s? In a\\n hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O\\'Rielly\\n in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\\n had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\\n Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\\n thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\\n aboard gone in a churning cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sweat pouring off him, O\\'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\\n the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn\\'t any\\n more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\\n room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\\n and a meter registered beside the Burnerman\\'s bunk and on the Burner\\n Chief\\'s console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\\n officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O\\'Rielly had been in Four\\'s watch\\n room. Nobody had passed through. O\\'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\\n By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\\n inquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\\n mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O\\'Rielly\\n saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\\n some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\\n his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\\n that way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\\n either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\\n O\\'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\\n of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy\\'s most secret dreams. \"I\\n couldn\\'t stand the heat any longer and I couldn\\'t open that big door.\\n So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\\n naturally you couldn\\'t hear me walk out while your back was turned\\n resetting the control.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\\n until she couldn\\'t sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\\n where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\\n breath against woman\\'s supremacy in all matters. That male character\\n trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\\n O\\'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one\\'s person, heard\\n himself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\\n that bother to get out here!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You\\'re so kind. But I\\'m afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\\n there.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I\\'ll drop a\\n suggestion in the Old Woman\\'s box first chance I get.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You\\'re so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You\\'re so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\\n that O\\'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\\n her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\\n in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\\n when he\\'d been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\\n had a jug to cheer one\\'s parting with one\\'s money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\\n flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\\n buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\\n what about that control?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What control?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, that little thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O\\'Rielly\\n sharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\\n Lemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\\n again probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly said while bowing\\n gracefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Higher than a swacked skunk\\'s tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\\n snapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\\n Burner Chief Terrence Callahan\\'s mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody\\'s,\\n would be improved by knowledge of she who was in O\\'Rielly\\'s shower now.\\n Not that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\\n Oh, very quite!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn\\'t I tell you\\n to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman\\'s taking a Venus bigwig\\n on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\\n she\\'ll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she\\'ll do anyway\\n about your fusion control!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\\n been thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\\n myself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O\\'Rielly\\'s shower\\n door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Venus dames,\" O\\'Rielly said dreamily, \"don\\'t boss anything, do they?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Callahan yelped like he\\'d been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\\n \"O\\'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\\n Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\\n position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\\n have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan\\'s eyes rolled like the\\n devil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O\\'Rielly, open your big ears\\n whilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\\n got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\\n everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\\n it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\\n the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\\n family—everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, that\\'s when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\\n with knots in their tails. Before the guys who\\'d brought the Venus\\n dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\\n pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones\\n back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on\\n Earth again there wouldn\\'t be enough left of Venus to find with an\\n electron microscope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\\n notions, right away there wouldn\\'t be enough Earth left to hide in an\\n atom\\'s eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.\\n Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million\\n light years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\\n deal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\\n stay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave\\n Venus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught\\n around a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything\\n at bargain basement prices.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O\\'Rielly said, still\\n dreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Pray heaven you\\'ll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten\\n foot of you! Even though you\\'d know she\\'d be your damnation wouldn\\'t\\n make a whit difference—you\\'d still act sappier than thirty-seven\\n angels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O\\'Rielly. \"Holy\\n hollering saints!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded with an airy\\n laugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\\n lived to tell it, has he?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\\n into his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O\\'Rielly snorted.\\n \"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\\n \"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain\\'t you? Some big enough to\\n stuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig\\'s bags,\\n even through customs? Just run \\'em through the big Geiger that tells\\n whether there\\'s any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself\\n one of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig\\'s pile of\\n \\'em.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Didn\\'t pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when\\n a crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.\\n Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his\\n ears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.\\n Wasn\\'t like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   With suddenly enlivened interest O\\'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how\\n come you know so much?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\\n to himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I\\'d had\\n a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\\n Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O\\'Rielly\\'s head. \"Look! I was\\n a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\\n twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more,\\n you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could\\n put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain\\'t high\\n on vino and ain\\'t been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we\\n feed the Old Woman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly responded cheerfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!\\n Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at\\n least!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.\\n Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway\\n was saved! And O\\'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\\n lovely neck and his own forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly\\'s shower door, however, opened abruptly. O\\'Rielly had not\\n opened it. O\\'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\\n his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn\\'t she\\n have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At sight of her, of course, Callahan\\'s eyes near popped from his old\\n head. \"Berta!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, I\\'m Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma\\'s\\n name is Berta and people say I\\'m just like she was a hundred and\\n twenty-five years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\\n was being slapped together again. \"O\\'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\\n pirate, couldn\\'t you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\\n you don\\'t have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\\n don\\'t flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\\n a zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\\n Trillium. Just like that, O\\'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\\n spiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\\n the doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\\n and coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\\n Trillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\\n ship. O\\'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don\\'t you\\n worry about another thing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, I\\'m not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\\n way Grandmamma knew it would!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly\\'s shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\\n bounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\\n don\\'t tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\\n to know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The watch room\\'s door had opened. Wouldn\\'t think the Old Woman was a\\n day over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\\n probably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\\n Frosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\\n looked at O\\'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\\n erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\\n robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\\n lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\\n from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\\n of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\\n you a question, did I not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Believe you did, ma\\'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\\n answer is, ma\\'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly and me was\\n discussing—ah—matrimony, ma\\'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly\\n here is considering it, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Wasn\\'t too bad a fib. The more O\\'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\\n ideas he got of doing things he\\'d never dreamt of before in his life.\\n Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman\\'s look was fit to\\n freeze O\\'Rielly\\'s brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\\n down here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, you\\'ll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma\\'am!\"\\n Callahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\\n women—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\\n the control phenomenon, ma\\'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\\n Burnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\\n said with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed \\'twouldn\\'t\\n bother me none if there wasn\\'t one of the things left in the world!\\n Present company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\\n courtly bow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan\\'s face,\\n then in O\\'Rielly\\'s vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\\n she muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\\n horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\\n again. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don\\'t you know what your shower is for?\\n Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\\n burner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\\n me, Your Excellency?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O\\'Rielly and Callahan much as\\n he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\\n ever told any Venus man what to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\\n steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\\n blowing her gaskets completely, O\\'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\\n door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\\n of person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\\n Excellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\\n sweat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\\n first, Your Excellency.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\\n \"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\\n Woman, a prime symbol of her gender\\'s superiority, whipped a razor edge\\n onto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain\\'s quarters are more\\n satisfactory.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s watch room. Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from busting\\n out laughing for joy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And\\n betwixt O\\'Rielly\\'s grand brain and Callahan\\'s great experience she\\'d be\\n happy forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and\\n yanked open the doors under O\\'Rielly\\'s bunk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of\\n course.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the\\n sabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Trillium,\" O\\'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to\\n keep coming out of hiding just when nobody\\'s going to find you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O\\'Rielly would have gladly\\n drowned himself if he could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of\\n outer space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman\\'s company, and for\\n her leaving her planet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Shut up!\" His Excellency\\'s ear beards were standing straight out\\n sideways. \"I\\'ll handle this!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent\\n Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard\\n back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President\\n of Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled\\n at that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at\\n O\\'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan\\n looked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium\\'s brave loveliness and\\n protect it to his last breath of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.\\n Panels on opposite walls lit up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\\n \"Interplanetary emergency.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally\\n pleasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Madame President\\'s office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Mr. President\\'s office. He is in personal command of our glorious war\\n efforts.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship.\\n Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The flunkies\\' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a\\n blizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The\\n facts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,\\n that were as fierce as an eagle\\'s, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My\\n own granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his\\n Excellency, \"what\\'s this nonsense?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with\\n annoyance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\\n \"Some silly female cackling now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one\\'s left hand on a\\n desk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by\\n those two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by\\n myself, and Mr. O\\'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President\\'s ear beards stood near straight up\\n as he roared, \"You couldn\\'t have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,\\n tell the truth!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Obviously Trillium\\'s poor little brain has been drugged,\" His\\n Excellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn\\'t know the first\\n thing about such things!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I\\'ve been married to her\\n for a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she\\'s the finest\\n rattle-brain I ever knew!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five\\n years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling\\n volcano. \"The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....\\n Berta? Impossible!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Madame President\\'s shapely finger now rested full on the button that\\n could launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a\\n thousand years. \"I\\'m afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame\\n President stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter\\'s actions have every mark\\n of an invasion tactic by your government.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President\\'s finger now lay\\n poised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow\\n Earth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under\\n your official command! Weren\\'t you, Trillium dear?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring\\n our cause to the attention of Earth\\'s President. If Earth will only\\n stop buying from Venus, you won\\'t have any money to squander on your\\n wars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what\\'s wrong with my wars? People\\n have to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobody\\n around here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. But\\n nobody on Venus dies from the things any more.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they\\n haven\\'t time for us women. That\\'s why we always radiated such a fatal\\n attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men home\\n doing useful work!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every ten\\n months. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home and\\n be lonely!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now you just listen to me, Trillium!\" Grandpapa President was all\\n Venus manhood laying down the law. \"That\\'s the way things have been on\\n Venus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can\\'t\\n change it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during these\\n conversations,\" Madame President said crisply. \"Earth is terminating\\n all trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What?\" Grandpapa\\'s beards near pulled his ears off. \"It\\'s not legal!\\n You can\\'t get away with this!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Take your finger off that trigger, boy!\" a heavenly voice similar to\\n Trillium\\'s advised from the Venus panel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. \"Berta! What are you doing\\n here? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Were.\" Features more beautifully mature than Trillium\\'s crowded onto\\n the panel too. \"From now on I\\'m doing the deciding.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nonsense! You\\'re only my wife!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody\\'s turning this planet into\\n another Earth where a man can\\'t even sneeze unless some woman says so!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Take him away, girls,\" Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse was\\n yanked from view.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His bellows, however, could be heard yet. \"Unhand me, you fool\\n creatures! Guards! Guards!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Save your breath,\" Berta advised him. \"And while you\\'re in the cooler,\\n enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are in\\n control everywhere now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Dimmy,\" Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, \"you have beat\\n around the bush with me long enough. Now say it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Dimdooly—the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere\\n Earthmen kowtowing to a mere woman—swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,\\n then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had\\n enough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\\n love only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\\n works. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we\\n Venus women had our own men in our power.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof\\n enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth\\'s\\n tranquility.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.\\n Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked\\n away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away\\n from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest\\n headache in history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree\\n perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been\\n conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame\\n President of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to\\n receive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest\\n convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological\\n moment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the\\n communications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels\\n broadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the\\n top man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take\\n over Dimmy\\'s credentials.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said\\n graciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that\\n Mr. O\\'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our\\n revolution better than they knew.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No\\n doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs\\n best.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged\\n Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O\\'Rielly and Callahan.\\n Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his\\n old conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure\\n before returning to your stations.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, well,\" O\\'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond\\n earshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of\\n Saturn? Lucky we ain\\'t programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\\n crows for breakfast.\" Callahan\\'s old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\\n grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O\\'Rielly\\n said in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\\n did Trillium\\'s Grandmamma let him go?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Venus guys wasn\\'t so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\\n like to himself, \"they\\'d of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,\\n guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.\\n Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won\\'t be one\\n much longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves\\n but didn\\'t, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing\\n to take over Venus, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium\\n before her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did \\'our boy\\' leave\\n Grandmamma?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, ma\\'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn\\'t heard a word O\\'Rielly\\n said, \"you could sweet-talk \\'em, kiss \\'em and hold \\'em tighter\\'n\\n Billy-be-damned. And that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I\\'m not sure,\" O\\'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, \\'that\\'s all.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?\\n Course not.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Ain\\'t nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma\\'am.\\n Venus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So what?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Tickles \\'em, boy, tickles \\'em!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'O\\'Rielly starts to talk about \"venus dames\" unprompted and acting strangely. Why?\\n\\n (A) He\\'s out of sorts from working on the controls. The heat got to him. \\n (B) He\\'s had an experience with them in the past, and wants to discuss is with Callahan. \\n (C) It\\'s the effect that Venus women have on Earth men. The woman\\'s presence changes his focus. \\n (D) He\\'s embarrassed about the controls malfunction and is trying to change the subject \\n\\n\\nIMAGE OF SPLENDOR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   By LU KELLA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,\\n\\n\\n    it was a hell of a world for men ... and\\n\\n\\n    Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly particularly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The intercom roared fit to blow O\\'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"On my way, sir!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman\\n O\\'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already\\n throwing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble\\n whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\\n the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\\n chance! Swiftly O\\'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\\n throbbing rumble changed tone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Callahan\\'s voice crackled now through the helmet\\'s ear contact.\\n \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\\n Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn\\'t you lock them controls before\\n blast-off?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"If every control hadn\\'t been locked in correct setting,\" O\\'Rielly\\n answered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\\n registered before blast-off—wouldn\\'t it, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I don\\'t know yet, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The icy knot in O\\'Rielly\\'s stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\\n this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O\\'Rielly\\'s? In a\\n hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O\\'Rielly\\n in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\\n had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\\n Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\\n thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\\n aboard gone in a churning cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Sweat pouring off him, O\\'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\\n the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn\\'t any\\n more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\\n room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\\n and a meter registered beside the Burnerman\\'s bunk and on the Burner\\n Chief\\'s console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\\n officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O\\'Rielly had been in Four\\'s watch\\n room. Nobody had passed through. O\\'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\\n By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\\n inquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Well, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\\n mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O\\'Rielly\\n saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\\n some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\\n his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\\n that way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\\n either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\\n O\\'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\\n of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy\\'s most secret dreams. \"I\\n couldn\\'t stand the heat any longer and I couldn\\'t open that big door.\\n So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\\n naturally you couldn\\'t hear me walk out while your back was turned\\n resetting the control.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\\n until she couldn\\'t sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\\n where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\\n breath against woman\\'s supremacy in all matters. That male character\\n trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\\n O\\'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one\\'s person, heard\\n himself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\\n that bother to get out here!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You\\'re so kind. But I\\'m afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\\n there.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I\\'ll drop a\\n suggestion in the Old Woman\\'s box first chance I get.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You\\'re so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You\\'re so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\\n that O\\'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\\n her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\\n in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\\n when he\\'d been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\\n had a jug to cheer one\\'s parting with one\\'s money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\\n flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\\n buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\\n what about that control?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What control?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, that little thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O\\'Rielly\\n sharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\\n Lemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\\n again probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly said while bowing\\n gracefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Higher than a swacked skunk\\'s tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\\n snapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\\n Burner Chief Terrence Callahan\\'s mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody\\'s,\\n would be improved by knowledge of she who was in O\\'Rielly\\'s shower now.\\n Not that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\\n Oh, very quite!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn\\'t I tell you\\n to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman\\'s taking a Venus bigwig\\n on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\\n she\\'ll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she\\'ll do anyway\\n about your fusion control!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\\n been thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\\n myself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O\\'Rielly\\'s shower\\n door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Venus dames,\" O\\'Rielly said dreamily, \"don\\'t boss anything, do they?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Callahan yelped like he\\'d been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\\n \"O\\'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\\n Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\\n position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\\n have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan\\'s eyes rolled like the\\n devil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O\\'Rielly, open your big ears\\n whilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\\n got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\\n everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\\n it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\\n the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\\n family—everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, that\\'s when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\\n with knots in their tails. Before the guys who\\'d brought the Venus\\n dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\\n pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones\\n back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on\\n Earth again there wouldn\\'t be enough left of Venus to find with an\\n electron microscope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\\n notions, right away there wouldn\\'t be enough Earth left to hide in an\\n atom\\'s eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.\\n Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million\\n light years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\\n deal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\\n stay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave\\n Venus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught\\n around a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything\\n at bargain basement prices.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O\\'Rielly said, still\\n dreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Pray heaven you\\'ll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten\\n foot of you! Even though you\\'d know she\\'d be your damnation wouldn\\'t\\n make a whit difference—you\\'d still act sappier than thirty-seven\\n angels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O\\'Rielly. \"Holy\\n hollering saints!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded with an airy\\n laugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\\n lived to tell it, has he?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\\n into his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O\\'Rielly snorted.\\n \"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\\n \"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain\\'t you? Some big enough to\\n stuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig\\'s bags,\\n even through customs? Just run \\'em through the big Geiger that tells\\n whether there\\'s any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself\\n one of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig\\'s pile of\\n \\'em.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Didn\\'t pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when\\n a crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.\\n Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his\\n ears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.\\n Wasn\\'t like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   With suddenly enlivened interest O\\'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how\\n come you know so much?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\\n to himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I\\'d had\\n a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\\n Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O\\'Rielly\\'s head. \"Look! I was\\n a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\\n twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more,\\n you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could\\n put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain\\'t high\\n on vino and ain\\'t been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we\\n feed the Old Woman?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly responded cheerfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!\\n Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at\\n least!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.\\n Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway\\n was saved! And O\\'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\\n lovely neck and his own forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly\\'s shower door, however, opened abruptly. O\\'Rielly had not\\n opened it. O\\'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\\n his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn\\'t she\\n have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   At sight of her, of course, Callahan\\'s eyes near popped from his old\\n head. \"Berta!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, I\\'m Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma\\'s\\n name is Berta and people say I\\'m just like she was a hundred and\\n twenty-five years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\\n was being slapped together again. \"O\\'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\\n pirate, couldn\\'t you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\\n you don\\'t have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\\n don\\'t flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\\n a zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\\n Trillium. Just like that, O\\'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\\n spiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\\n the doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\\n and coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\\n Trillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\\n ship. O\\'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don\\'t you\\n worry about another thing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, I\\'m not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\\n way Grandmamma knew it would!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly\\'s shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\\n bounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\\n don\\'t tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\\n to know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The watch room\\'s door had opened. Wouldn\\'t think the Old Woman was a\\n day over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\\n probably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\\n Frosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\\n looked at O\\'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\\n erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\\n robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\\n lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\\n from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\\n of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\\n you a question, did I not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Believe you did, ma\\'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\\n answer is, ma\\'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly and me was\\n discussing—ah—matrimony, ma\\'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly\\n here is considering it, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Wasn\\'t too bad a fib. The more O\\'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\\n ideas he got of doing things he\\'d never dreamt of before in his life.\\n Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman\\'s look was fit to\\n freeze O\\'Rielly\\'s brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\\n down here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, you\\'ll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma\\'am!\"\\n Callahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\\n women—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\\n the control phenomenon, ma\\'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\\n Burnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\\n said with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed \\'twouldn\\'t\\n bother me none if there wasn\\'t one of the things left in the world!\\n Present company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\\n courtly bow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan\\'s face,\\n then in O\\'Rielly\\'s vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\\n she muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\\n horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\\n again. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don\\'t you know what your shower is for?\\n Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\\n burner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\\n me, Your Excellency?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O\\'Rielly and Callahan much as\\n he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\\n ever told any Venus man what to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\\n steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\\n blowing her gaskets completely, O\\'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\\n door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\\n of person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\\n Excellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\\n sweat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\\n first, Your Excellency.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\\n \"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\\n Woman, a prime symbol of her gender\\'s superiority, whipped a razor edge\\n onto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain\\'s quarters are more\\n satisfactory.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s watch room. Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from busting\\n out laughing for joy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And\\n betwixt O\\'Rielly\\'s grand brain and Callahan\\'s great experience she\\'d be\\n happy forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and\\n yanked open the doors under O\\'Rielly\\'s bunk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of\\n course.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the\\n sabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Trillium,\" O\\'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to\\n keep coming out of hiding just when nobody\\'s going to find you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O\\'Rielly would have gladly\\n drowned himself if he could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of\\n outer space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman\\'s company, and for\\n her leaving her planet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Shut up!\" His Excellency\\'s ear beards were standing straight out\\n sideways. \"I\\'ll handle this!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent\\n Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard\\n back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President\\n of Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled\\n at that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at\\n O\\'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan\\n looked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium\\'s brave loveliness and\\n protect it to his last breath of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.\\n Panels on opposite walls lit up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\\n \"Interplanetary emergency.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally\\n pleasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Madame President\\'s office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Mr. President\\'s office. He is in personal command of our glorious war\\n efforts.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship.\\n Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The flunkies\\' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a\\n blizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The\\n facts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,\\n that were as fierce as an eagle\\'s, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My\\n own granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his\\n Excellency, \"what\\'s this nonsense?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with\\n annoyance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\\n \"Some silly female cackling now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one\\'s left hand on a\\n desk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by\\n those two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by\\n myself, and Mr. O\\'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President\\'s ear beards stood near straight up\\n as he roared, \"You couldn\\'t have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,\\n tell the truth!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Obviously Trillium\\'s poor little brain has been drugged,\" His\\n Excellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn\\'t know the first\\n thing about such things!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I\\'ve been married to her\\n for a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she\\'s the finest\\n rattle-brain I ever knew!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five\\n years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling\\n volcano. \"The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....\\n Berta? Impossible!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Madame President\\'s shapely finger now rested full on the button that\\n could launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a\\n thousand years. \"I\\'m afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame\\n President stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter\\'s actions have every mark\\n of an invasion tactic by your government.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President\\'s finger now lay\\n poised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow\\n Earth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under\\n your official command! Weren\\'t you, Trillium dear?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring\\n our cause to the attention of Earth\\'s President. If Earth will only\\n stop buying from Venus, you won\\'t have any money to squander on your\\n wars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what\\'s wrong with my wars? People\\n have to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobody\\n around here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. But\\n nobody on Venus dies from the things any more.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they\\n haven\\'t time for us women. That\\'s why we always radiated such a fatal\\n attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men home\\n doing useful work!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every ten\\n months. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home and\\n be lonely!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Now you just listen to me, Trillium!\" Grandpapa President was all\\n Venus manhood laying down the law. \"That\\'s the way things have been on\\n Venus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can\\'t\\n change it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during these\\n conversations,\" Madame President said crisply. \"Earth is terminating\\n all trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What?\" Grandpapa\\'s beards near pulled his ears off. \"It\\'s not legal!\\n You can\\'t get away with this!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Take your finger off that trigger, boy!\" a heavenly voice similar to\\n Trillium\\'s advised from the Venus panel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. \"Berta! What are you doing\\n here? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Were.\" Features more beautifully mature than Trillium\\'s crowded onto\\n the panel too. \"From now on I\\'m doing the deciding.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Nonsense! You\\'re only my wife!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody\\'s turning this planet into\\n another Earth where a man can\\'t even sneeze unless some woman says so!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Take him away, girls,\" Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse was\\n yanked from view.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   His bellows, however, could be heard yet. \"Unhand me, you fool\\n creatures! Guards! Guards!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Save your breath,\" Berta advised him. \"And while you\\'re in the cooler,\\n enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are in\\n control everywhere now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Dimmy,\" Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, \"you have beat\\n around the bush with me long enough. Now say it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Dimdooly—the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere\\n Earthmen kowtowing to a mere woman—swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,\\n then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had\\n enough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\\n love only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\\n works. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we\\n Venus women had our own men in our power.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof\\n enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth\\'s\\n tranquility.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.\\n Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked\\n away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away\\n from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest\\n headache in history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree\\n perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been\\n conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame\\n President of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to\\n receive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest\\n convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological\\n moment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the\\n communications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels\\n broadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the\\n top man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take\\n over Dimmy\\'s credentials.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said\\n graciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that\\n Mr. O\\'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our\\n revolution better than they knew.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No\\n doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs\\n best.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged\\n Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O\\'Rielly and Callahan.\\n Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his\\n old conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure\\n before returning to your stations.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Oh, well,\" O\\'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond\\n earshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of\\n Saturn? Lucky we ain\\'t programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\\n crows for breakfast.\" Callahan\\'s old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\\n grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O\\'Rielly\\n said in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\\n did Trillium\\'s Grandmamma let him go?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Venus guys wasn\\'t so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\\n like to himself, \"they\\'d of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,\\n guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.\\n Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won\\'t be one\\n much longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves\\n but didn\\'t, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing\\n to take over Venus, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   O\\'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium\\n before her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did \\'our boy\\' leave\\n Grandmamma?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Yes, ma\\'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn\\'t heard a word O\\'Rielly\\n said, \"you could sweet-talk \\'em, kiss \\'em and hold \\'em tighter\\'n\\n Billy-be-damned. And that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"I\\'m not sure,\" O\\'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, \\'that\\'s all.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?\\n Course not.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Ain\\'t nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma\\'am.\\n Venus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"So what?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \"Tickles \\'em, boy, tickles \\'em!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'],\n",
