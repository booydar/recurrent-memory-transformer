The Parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the Disclosing Party‚Äôs Proprietary Information, money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of this Agreement. Because a violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement will likely cause irreparable loss and harm which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages in an action at law, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief or other appropriate equitable relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Disclosing Party.\\n8. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise between the Parties out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot be settled by amicable mutual accord without undue delay, shall be filed in the courts of Delaware.\\n9.

This Agreement sets forth the Parties‚Äô obligations regarding the use and disclosure of such information and regarding various related matters.\\nThe Parties, intending to be legally bound, acknowledge and agree as follows:\\n1. Limitations on Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. Neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient‚Äôs Representatives (as defined in Section 13 below) will, at any time, directly or indirectly:\\n(a) make use of any of the Provider‚Äôs Confidential Information (as defined in Section 12 below), except for the specific purpose of considering, evaluating and negotiating a Transaction between the Parties; or\\n(b) subject to Section 4 below, disclose any of the Provider‚Äôs Confidential Information to any other Person (as defined in Section 13 below).\\nThe Recipient will be liable and responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives and for any other action or conduct on the part of any of its Representatives that is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement. The Recipient will (at its own expense) take all reasonable actions necessary to restrain its Representatives from making any unauthorized use or disclosure of any of the Provider‚Äôs Confidential Information.\\n2. Provider Contact Person.

For clarity, if the Recipient disclosed, or permitted the disclosure of, any such certain Confidential Information to an Impermissible Representative prior to the Recipient‚Äôs receipt of the Permitted Representatives Notice, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.\\n(c) If the Recipient or any of the Recipient‚Äôs Representatives is required by law or governmental regulation or by subpoena or other valid legal process to disclose any of the Provider‚Äôs Confidential Information to any Person, then the Recipient will promptly provide the Provider with written notice of the applicable law, regulation or process so that the Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

Obligations Each party agrees that it shall not make use of, disseminate, or in any way disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person, firm, or business, except to the extent necessary for the Transaction. The existence of any business negotiations, discussions, consultations, or agreements in progress between the parties shall not be released to any form of public media, unless agreed between the parties in writing. Both parties acknowledge that the Receiving Party shall protect the secrecy of all Confidential Information, that said Confidential Information is of critical importance to the Disclosing Party, that any violation of this Agreement would seriously and irreparably impair and damage the Disclosing Party's business, and that the Recipient shall keep all Confidential Information in a fiduciary capacity for the sole benefit of the Disclosing Party.
